# topocor
The topocor_minnaert.py script implements topographic correction of satellite images. It applies a Minnaert algorithm with k coefficient
dependent on the slope range. This script was produced to apply topographic correction to full Sentinel and Landsat scenes within the framework of the UK Land Cover Mapping Development project.
